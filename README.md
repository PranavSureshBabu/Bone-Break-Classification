**About the Dataset**

The dataset covers a range of bone fracture classes, such as avulsion fractures, comminuted fractures, fracture-dislocations, greenstick fractures, hairline fractures, impacted fractures, longitudinal fractures, oblique fractures, pathological fractures, and spiral fractures.

**Objective :**

The goal of this project is to classify X-ray or bone images into different categories indicating whether a bone is broken or not. This type of classification can assist in automated medical diagnosis. 

**Tools and Libraries used**

* TensorFlow/Keras
* Matplotlib and Numpy
* Scikit learn metrics
* Streamlit - to upload the X-ray image and get the predicted fracture type
